### Defining project

Now, when your future project was loaded you should properly configure it. In this step, we will 
change several root files.

#### `course-info.yaml`
This file also exists in the root project directory and describes a project for hyperskill servers.
At first, let's change the `title` value placed in the 2 line. Here you should also select a proper 
project title name because this title will be displayed in the hyperskill. So, you also can check 
our previous projects for examples. Here is one of them: `Cinema Room Manager`

`summary` value contains a short project description that will be also displayed
in the hyperskill, so here you can bravely go to the hyperskill and check several projects summary.
This field also supports an html, so you can use a hyperlink and other stuff as well.

NOTE: You can configure previous values later, but don't forget about it.

The last value we should change is `content`. Here we should also rename `Project Name`.
This value is linked with the folder in our project root. At now, they have the same titles and hyperskill
can define that our project lies in this folder. If their title will be different the EduTools plugin might not
work properly, so feel free to change and this folder title too.

#### `lesson-info.yaml` in your project
This file you can find in the freshly renamed folder from the previous step. In this file, we define a
set of stages that our project will use. Feel free to create as many stages as your project requires
inside the `content` value.

NOTE: For this template, there will be only 1 stage. You also can check stage names from our
previous projects, but here is one of them: `Input changes`.

NOTE: This file also may contain a `current_task` value that defines in which stage the user is located now.
This value should be managed by the EduTools plugin.
